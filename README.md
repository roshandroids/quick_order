## 💡 How It Works: Simple Steps to Smarter Service!

QuickOrder flawlessly blends digital efficiency with the personal touch of traditional dine-in:

1.  **Customer Chooses & Creates:** A diner opens the **QuickOrder app**, explores the menu, customizes their perfect meal, and with a tap, generates a unique **QR code** on their phone. It’s their digital order summary! 📲
2.  **Server Scans & Sends:** When a server approaches, the customer simply shows their phone. The server scans the QR code with their QuickOrder-enabled device, instantly reviewing and sending the order directly to the kitchen. No more writing down lengthy orders! ✍️➡️💻
3.  **Hybrid Harmony for All:** For those who prefer to order verbally, no worries! The server can manually input the order into their device, which then generates a unique **coupon number** for the customer. This means even a verbal order can be tracked via the app later! 🗣️➡️🔢
4.  **Kitchen Receives & Prepares:** Kitchen staff receive clear, accurate, and prioritized orders on their screen, ensuring meals are prepared correctly and efficiently. Deliciousness delivered! 🍽️
